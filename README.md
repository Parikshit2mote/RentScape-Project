# Project Overview
RentScape is a room and restaurant booking system where users can find and book places to stay. 
It ensures that a room or restaurant can only be booked by one user at a time, preventing multiple simultaneous bookings. 
You also plan to include a category-based filtering system for better user experience.

## Core Features
1️⃣ User Management
User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to their accounts.
User Roles: Two types of users – Guests (who book rooms) and Hosts (who list rooms/restaurants).

2️⃣ Booking System
Real-time Booking: Only one person can book a room at a time.
Disabled Booking Button: When a room is booked, the booking button is disabled for others.
Calendar & Time Selection: Users can select available dates and times while booking.

3️⃣ Room & Restaurant Listings
Listing System: Hosts can add rooms/restaurants, including descriptions, images, pricing, and availability.
Categories Feature: Users can filter listings by category (e.g., "Luxury," "Budget," "Sea View," "Pet-Friendly").

4️⃣ Map Integration
Location-Based Search: Users can search for listings based on their location.
Leaflet with OpenStreetMap: You're using Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap to display property locations.

5️⃣ Payment System (Optional)
Payment Integration: Users can make payments online for booking (can be integrated with Razorpay, Stripe, etc.).

6️⃣ UI/UX Improvements
